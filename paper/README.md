# LaTeX Template

This template is intended for physics students at Hasselt University.
Using this template you will be able to write a report of your bachelor project in paper format.

# How to use?
Click on the green 'code' button and select 'Download ZIP'.
Unzip to use locally or upload as is to use with overleaf.

# Notes
This template is built on multicols meaning floats are not compatible. As a workaround use the 'H' position specifier in a table or figure environment.

# Not Physics?

Feel free to use it as a student of another faculty but know that you might need tweaks to the template.
Send an email to allyson.robert@uhasselt.be or post an issue to request changes.
