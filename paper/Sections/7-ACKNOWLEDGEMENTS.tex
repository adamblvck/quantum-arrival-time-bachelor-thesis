\textit{Author contributions}

\textbf{Adam Blazejczak} wrote the code and scripts for simulating the 1D and 2D TDSE in python, has researched methods for improving numerical calculations, and came up with creative ways to analyse the resulting data. Adam also wrote this thesis from the ground up. \textbf{Ward Struyve}, \textbf{Siddhant Das} and their respective groups came up with the idea for analysing the free fall experiment across opaque barriers, to account for initial conditions. They also provided invaluable insight into Bohmian Mechanics. \textbf{Jef Hooyberghs} contributed to the interpretation, presentation and coherence of the thesis.

\textit{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank all my friends, peers, and colleagues who have supported me mentally and emotionally during my bachelor degree in physics at a mature age. I also would like to thank all members of the faculty at \textbf{Hasselt University} and \textbf{KU Leuven} for joining forces in creative ways, to deliver an impeccable learning experience and initiation into physics study, for young and older students alike.
